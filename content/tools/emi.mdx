## FAQs

### What is EMI?
EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment, which is the fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month.

### How is EMI calculated?
EMI is calculated using the formula:

```
EMI = P × r × (1+r)^n ÷ ((1+r)^n−1)
```

Where:
- `P` is the principal loan amount
- `r` is the monthly interest rate
- `n` is the number of monthly installments

## HowTo: Calculate EMI

1. Determine the loan amount (P).
2. Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate (r = annual rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100).
3. Use the formula to calculate EMI.
4. Round the result to two decimal places for accuracy.
